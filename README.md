DO NOT Download this!!!!! This is for educational purposes only. I am reconstructing the prologue of TTYD to cement my understanding of Python concepts. If you want to play this game, go buy the remastered version here: https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch/
This is just a cli simulation, seriously go buy the actual game it is actually super fun!!
Nintendo, pls no sue :)
